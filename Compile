To compile a code best thing to do is to locate to the project folder and use the following command:
        javac search/run/Run.java search/src/code/*.java search/src/ex/*.java search/src/code/attribute/Att.java

If you are not located on the project folder add:
        /home/<name of computer>/<destination of the project>/
to every element of the compile path; new command will look like:
        javac /home/<name of computer>/<destination of the project>/search/run/Run.java
              /home/<name of computer>/<destination of the project>/search/src/code/*.java
              /home/<name of computer>/<destination of the project>/search/src/ex/*.java
              /home/<name of computer>/<destination of the project>/search/src/code/attribute/Att.java

Failing to compile either one of the files:
        Run.java
        Node.java
        Tree.java
        Att.java
        InvalidPathException.java
        NoFolderException.java
will result in compiler failure.
